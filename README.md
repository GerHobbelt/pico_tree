PicoTree is a C++ header only library with [Python bindings](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11) for nearest neighbor searches and range searches using a KdTree.

Available under the [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) license.

# Capabilities

* KdTree
  * Nearest neighbors, approximate nearest neighbors, radius, and box searches.
  * Customizable nearest neighbor searches, [metrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_(mathematics)) and tree splitting techniques.
  * Compile time and run time known dimensions.
  * Static tree builds.
  * Thread safe queries.

The examples show how PicoTree can be used:

* PicoTree supports interfacing with different types of points or point sets through a traits class. This can be one of the default traits classes or a custom implementation:
  * `pico_tree::StdTraits<>` provides a traits interface to support any `std::vector<PointType>`. It requires a specialization of `pico_tree::StdPointTraits<>` for each different [PointType](./examples/pico_toolshed/pico_toolshed/point.hpp).
  * The implementation of `pico_tree::StdTraits<>` can be used as an example to create a [custom](./src/pico_tree/pico_tree/std_traits.hpp) traits class.
* Using the [KdTree](./examples/kd_tree/kd_tree.cpp) and creating a custom search visitor.
* Support for [Eigen](./examples/eigen/eigen.cpp) and [OpenCV](./examples/opencv/opencv.cpp) data types.
* How to use the [KdTree with Python](./examples/python/kd_tree.py).

# Requirements

Minimum:

* A compiler that is compliant with the C++11 standard or higher.
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/). It is also possible to just copy and paste the [pico_tree](./src/pico_tree/) directory into an include directory.

Optional:

* [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl). Needed for generating documentation.
* [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest). Used for running unit tests.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org). To run the example that shows how Eigen data types can be used in combination with PicoTree.
* [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). To run the OpenCV example that shows how to work with OpenCV data types.
* [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann), [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) and a compiler that is compliant with the C++17 standard are needed to run the comparison benchmark between nanoflann and PicoTree.

Python bindings:
* [Python](https://www.python.org/). Version 3.5 or higher.
* [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11). Used to ease the creation of Python bindings. Available under the [BSD](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11/blob/master/LICENSE) license and copyright.
* [OpenMP](https://www.openmp.org/). For parallelization of queries.
* [numpy](https://numpy.org/). Points and search results are represented by ndarrays.
* [scikit-build](https://scikit-build.readthedocs.io/). Glue between CMake and setuptools.

# Build

Build using [CMake](https://cmake.org/):

```console
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
$ make install
$ make pico_tree_doc
```

Similarly with [MSYS2](https://github.com/msys2/) and [MinGW64](http://mingw-w64.org/):

```console
$ ...
$ cmake.exe ../ -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:/msys64/mingw64/local
$ mingw32-make.exe
$ ...
```

```cmake
find_package(PicoTree REQUIRED)

add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(myexe PUBLIC PicoTree::PicoTree)
```

Install with pip:

```console
$ pip install ./pico_tree
```

Set a generator for use with MinGW:

```console
$ pip install ./pico_tree --install-option="-GMinGW Makefiles"
```
